1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keepin all your work local?

To share my work public and maybe ask for opinion of others without commiting the changes in my local project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's better to commit the changes manually and not automatically, so in this way you have control of what changes you want to make in your core project.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is to make a different path from a commit in your repository, clone is to copy a whole repository en your pc, and fork is to make a copy of someone else repository in your account on github.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It benefits at the moment of merging the localy repository with the remote one, because the remote has a pointer in wichs it can compare the changes that has been made localy and how different they are of the remote, or if they are a continuation of the previous work.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Working on other parts of a public project or fixing bugs, easier to fix and testing, but harder to coordinate at the moment you want to   help with a current developed feature.
