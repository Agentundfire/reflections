1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keepin all your work local?

To share my work public and maybe ask for opinion of others without commiting the changes in my local project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's better to commit the changes manually and not automatically, so in this way you have control of what changes you want to make in your core project.
